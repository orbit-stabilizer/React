This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

------------------------------------------------------------

## Goal of the project:
To build on my basic React knowledge. Inspired by https://todomvc.com/examples/react/

## Lessons learned/practiced:
1. Managing multiple components
2. Creating a list of components
3. Having as small of a state as possible, while not sacrificing functionality
4. Using https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html for planning

## Points to improve on for next time:
1. Follow the 'Thinking in React' steps in full 
2. Give more thought to the design structure and setup in the planning phase

## Differences between my app and todomvc:
1. Mine does not allow editing of todos
2. Todomvc uses routing to change between 'all', 'active', and 'completed' - while my app uses state to accomplish the same thing
