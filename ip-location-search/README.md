This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Goal of the project:
To become familiar with the basics of React

## Lessons learned/practiced:
1. State
2. Class based vs functional components
3. Props: specifically, passing values and passing functions as callbacks
4. Arrow functions
5. Using Fetch to make API requests
6. React vs ReactDOM
7. Exporting components

## Points to improve upon for next time:
1. Have a clear idea of what the project should be before starting
    * Create mockups of the different views and actions
2. Focus more on the architectural design of the component structure
